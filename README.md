# DriveSmart

DriveSmart is an AI driving assistant app that helps new drivers navigate safely and practice mastering the art of driving on the roads.

## About

Over 7.3 million motor vehicle accidents occur each year in the United States alone. Moreover, the number one cause of automobile accidents is distracted driving. And with the growing number of teens and new drivers on the road, the statistics are alarming with teen crash rates being more than four times greater than those of adult drivers. In fact, automobile accident rates are about 1.5 times higher for 16-year-olds than for 18–19-year-olds.


We were inspired by these statistics and personal stories to create a final solution and hopefully save lives. We’ve personally confronted the problems of not knowing where to start or not having a constant resource to answer questions, and our app covers all these areas through safe driving modules, machine learning route guidance, real-time fatigue and distraction detection, and driver behavior monitoring.

Watch our [pitch video](https://youtu.be/bqc_u6gAjtY) for a full demonstration of the app.

Our app aims to reduce the amount of distracted drivers on the roads by using artificial intelligence to track inattentiveness or fatigue in drivers and then alert them. We also provide AI route guidance that will learn and track driver preferences and patterns to reroute the navigation in an in-built GPS section. Furthermore, the app provides users with real-time driver behavior monitoring and safe driving modules to help new drivers learn safe driving skills.
